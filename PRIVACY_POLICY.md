# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

Minimal Volume Booster is a browser extension that amplifies audio in your active tab. We take your privacy seriously and keep all data on your device.

## Information Collected

The extension does **not** collect personal data. The only information stored is the volume level you choose for each tab, saved using Chrome's `storage` API so your preference persists between sessions.

This data stays on your device and is never transmitted to any server.

## Use of Information

Stored volume levels are used solely to restore your preferred audio settings for specific tabs. They are not used for analytics or tracking.

## Sharing of Information

We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute any information. The developer has no access to the data created or stored by the extension.

## Third-Party Services

Minimal Volume Booster does not integrate with third-party analytics services or advertisers.
